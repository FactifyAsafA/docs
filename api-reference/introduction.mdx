# Factify API

The Factify API provides a comprehensive platform for document management, version control, and collaborative access control. Build powerful applications that can create, manage, and share documents with granular permission controls.

## Getting Started

### Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.factify.com
```

### Authentication

The Factify API uses API keys for authentication. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.factify.com/documents
```

<Note>
Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
</Note>

### Rate Limits

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **Standard requests**: 1000 requests per hour
- **Document uploads**: 100 requests per hour
- **Collaborator invitations**: 50 requests per hour

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets

## Core Concepts

### Documents

Documents are the primary entities in the Factify system. Each document represents a file or content that can be:

- **Uploaded** with metadata (name, description)
- **Versioned** to track changes over time
- **Shared** with collaborators using role-based access control
- **Generated** into entry pages for external access

### Document Versions

Every document maintains a version history, allowing you to:

- Track changes over time
- Create new versions with different content
- Access historical versions
- Generate entry pages from specific versions

### Collaborators

Document access is managed through a collaborator system with five distinct roles:

- **Viewer**: Read-only access to documents
- **Commenter**: Can view and add comments
- **Collaborator**: Can edit content and create versions
- **Admin**: Can manage collaborators and settings
- **Owner**: Full control including ownership transfer

### Status Tracking

Collaborators have two possible statuses:

- **Active**: Has accepted the invitation and has full access
- **Invitation Pending**: Invited but hasn't accepted yet

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Design

The Factify API follows REST principles:

- **Resources** are identified by URLs
- **HTTP methods** indicate the action (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- **Status codes** communicate the result of operations
- **JSON** is used for all request and response bodies

### Consistent Response Format

All paginated responses follow a standardized structure:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 300,
    "limit": 20,
    "nextCursor": "dXNlcjEwMDA=",
    "previousCursor": "dXNlcjEwMjQ="
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and provides detailed error information:

```json
{
  "error": "validation_failed",
  "message": "Invalid request parameters",
  "details": {
    "field": "email",
    "issue": "Invalid email format"
  }
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### Document Management

Create and manage documents with full lifecycle support:

```bash
# Create a new document
POST /documents
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

# List all documents
GET /documents

# Get specific document
GET /documents/{id}
```

### Version Control

Track document changes with comprehensive versioning:

```bash
# Create new version
POST /documents/{document_id}/versions

# List document versions
GET /documents/{document_id}/versions

# Get specific version
GET /documents/{document_id}/versions/{version_id}
```

### Collaboration Management

Invite and manage document collaborators:

```bash
# Invite collaborators
POST /documents/{document_id}/collaborators
{
  "invitations": [
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "role": "Collaborator"
    }
  ],
  "sendEmail": true
}

# List collaborators
GET /documents/{document_id}/collaborators

# Update collaborator role
PATCH /documents/{document_id}/collaborators/{collaborator_id}
{
  "role": "Admin"
}
```

### Entry Page Generation

Generate public access pages for documents:

```bash
# Generate entry page
POST /documents/{document_id}/entry-page
{
  "template_id": "template_123",
  "version_id": "version_456"
}
```

## SDKs and Libraries

Official SDKs are available for popular programming languages:

- **JavaScript/Node.js**: `npm install @factify/api-client`
- **Python**: `pip install factify-api`
- **Go**: `go get github.com/factify/api-client-go`
- **PHP**: `composer require factify/api-client`

## Webhooks

Subscribe to real-time events for document and collaborator changes:

- Document created/updated
- Collaborator invited/removed
- Version created
- Entry page generated

Configure webhooks in your account settings to receive notifications at your endpoints.
